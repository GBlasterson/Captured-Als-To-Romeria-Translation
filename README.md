# Captured-Als-To-Romeria-Translation
https://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=/product_id/RJ365442.html 
This is possibly an ongoing translation of the DLsite work "Captured Als-to-Romeria".

At present, this is intended to be a mostly UI translation that features the sexy battle dialogue
and some item/skill translations to make the game more enjoyable to play.

I know there are some MTL translations for this game, so feel free to mix this translation with
your current one!

**NOTE: This patch does not cause the Fire or Hookshot glitch, so be careful when altering it.**
